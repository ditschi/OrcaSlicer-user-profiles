# Profile Update Configuration (Speed Optimized)
# Based on community-verified Kobra S1 settings and extSrc analysis
#
# SAFE LIMITS (Community + Official):
# - Max Acceleration: 20,000 mm/s² (official), using 18,000 (safety margin)
# - Max Speed: 600 mm/s (official), using 200-500 mm/s (practical)
# - Community tested: 20,000 accel + 200 mm/s = excellent quality
#
# PHILOSOPHY:
# - High accelerations (18,000) for fast direction changes
# - High speeds (200 mm/s) for infill/internals
# - Moderate outer walls (90 mm/s) for visible quality
# - Fast travel (500 mm/s) for multi-object prints
# - Adaptive cubic infill (faster than gyroid, less filament)
# - Monotonic line top surface (fast path planning)
# - 2 walls (user adjustable for strength)
# - reduce_infill_retraction: 1 (fewer retractions, faster)

# EXPECTED RESULTS & PERFORMANCE
# ========================================
#
# SPEED GAINS vs Optimized Profile:
# ├─ Acceleration: 4,000 → 18,000 mm/s² (+350%) ⚡⚡⚡
# ├─ Inner walls: 180 → 200 mm/s (+11%)
# ├─ Sparse infill: 180 → 200 mm/s (+11%)
# ├─ Internal solid: 180 → 200 mm/s (+11%)
# ├─ Top surface: 180 → 200 mm/s (+11%)
# ├─ Outer walls: 60 → 90 mm/s (+50%)
# ├─ Travel: 300 → 500 mm/s (+67%) ⚡
# └─ Initial layer: 40 → 70 mm/s (+75%)
#
# Estimated Time Savings:
# • Single object prints: ~35-40% faster
# • Multi-object prints: ~40-50% faster (travel speed benefit)
# • Community benchmark: 24-min Benchy @ 20k accel (vs ~35-40 min stock)
#
# QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS vs Optimized:
# ✓ Arachne wall generator (better variable widths, thin walls)
# ✓ Monotonic line top surfaces (good finish, faster path planning)
# ✓ 5 bottom layers vs 3 (better adhesion, fewer warping issues)
# ✓ 1.07 bottom flow ratio (compensates for high-speed under-extrusion)
# ✓ 0.2mm elephant foot compensation vs 0.1mm (better dimensional accuracy)
# ✓ Optimized line widths (105%, 125% initial, 107% inner walls)
# ✓ Firmware jerk control (smoother motion at high accelerations)
#
# SPEED OPTIMIZATIONS:
# ⚡ Adaptive cubic infill (faster slicing, less filament than gyroid)
# ⚡ Monotonic line top surface (simpler path planning than pure monotonic)
#
# TRADE-OFFS:
# ⚠ Adaptive cubic infill is weaker than gyroid (but faster)
# ⚠ Slightly more stringing (reduce_infill_retraction: 1)
# ⚠ Higher mechanical wear (18k accel vs 4k - still safe, well below 20k max)
# ⚠ Cooling becomes limiting factor on sharp overhangs (community-verified)
#
# SETTINGS PRESERVED (User Preference):
# • 2 wall loops (user can adjust manually for strength requirements)
# • No brim by default (user can enable if needed)
#
# COMMUNITY INSIGHTS:
# • German forum (drucktipps3d.de): 20k accel = "no visible quality loss"
# • Official Anycubic spec: 20,000 mm/s² max acceleration
# • Recommended: Keep door OPEN for PLA prints
# • Limiting factor: Part cooling on sharp corners at extreme speeds
#
# SAFETY NOTES:
# ✓ All settings within official hardware limits
# ✓ 18k accel provides safety margin vs 20k max
# ✓ Speeds tested and verified by community users
# ✓ Firmware jerk control prevents mechanical issues
#
# RECOMMENDATIONS:
# 1. Test on non-critical parts first
# 2. Monitor first few layers for adhesion issues
# 3. Adjust cooling if corners show artifacts
# 4. Increase wall_loops manually if part requires extra strength
# 5. Reduce speeds slightly (200→180) if layer adhesion issues occur
# 6. Keep firmware updated (community recommendation)
# 7. For PLA: Keep enclosure door OPEN (community advice)
